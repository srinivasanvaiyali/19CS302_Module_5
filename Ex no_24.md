# EX 24 Create a structure program to read(empno,dept and basic pay) and store the data of 3 employees and calculate their Gross Salary(da =10% and HRA=30% from BP).
## DATE:
## AIM:
To Create a structure program to read(empno,dept and basic pay) and store the data of 3 employees and calculate their Gross Salary(da =10% and HRA=30% from BP).

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Define a variables.
3. Create a structure program to read(empno,dept and basic pay) and store the data of 3 employees and calculate their Gross Salary(da =10% and HRA=30% from BP).
4. Read the value using scanf.
5. Ask the user to make an input.
6. Print out the answer.
7. End  

## Program:
```

#include <stdio.h> 
struct Employee {
int empno; 
char dept[100];
float basic_pay; 
float gross_salary; 
float da;
float hra;
};
int main() {
struct Employee employees[3]; 
for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
scanf("%d", &employees[i].empno); 
scanf("%s", employees[i].dept); 
scanf("%f", &employees[i].basic_pay);
employees[i].da = 0.1 * employees[i].basic_pay; // DA is 10% of Basic Pay 
employees[i].hra = 0.3 * employees[i].basic_pay; // HRA is 30% of Basic Pay 
employees[i].gross_salary = employees[i].basic_pay + employees[i].da +
employees[i].hra;
}
printf("Details of the Employee:\n");
for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
printf("%d %s %.f %.f %.f %.2f\n", employees[i].empno, employees[i].dept, 
employees[i].basic_pay, employees[i].da, employees[i].hra, employees[i].gross_salary);
}
return 0;
}
```

## Output:
